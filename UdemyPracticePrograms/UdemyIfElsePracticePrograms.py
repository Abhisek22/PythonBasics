#Practice using if-else statements.
#1. Write a program that assigns a greeting to a variable.
#2. Use an if statement to check if the greeting is "Hello".
#3. If it matches, print "Hello there!" and "How can I assist you today?".
#4. If it does not match, print "Greetings!".
#5. After the if-else block, print "Program has completed."

greeting = "Hello"
if greeting == "Hello":
    print("Hello there!")
    print("How can I assist you today?")
else:
    print("Greetings!")
print("Program has completed.")
